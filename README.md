 In this activity, I will create the code a candy store will use in their state of the art candy vending machine! 
 
 ### Instructions 
 * Create a loop that prints all of the candies in the store to the terminal with their index stored in brackets beside them.   
 *   For example: `"[0] Snickers"`  
 *   Create a second loop that runs for a set number of times as determined by the variable `allowance`.  
 *   For example: If allowance is equal to five, the loop should run five times.    
 *   Each time this loop runs, take in a user's input - preferably a number - and then add the candy with a matching index to the variable `candy_cart`.   
 *   For example: If the user enters "0" as their input, "Snickers" should be added into the `candy_cart` list.  
 *   Create a final loop to print all of the candies selected to the terminal. 
 *   Create a version of the same code which allows a user to select as much candy as they want up until they say they do not want any more.
